## Option Pricing Class
This is a class to price plain vanilla european call and put options, written in Java.

At the moment, the supported methods are the following:

- Price an option using either a Monte Carlo simulation or the Black and Scholes formula.
- Plot the random walk of a stock.

Perhaps in the future I'll add other derivatives and pricing methods. There is no fixed schedule or plan though.
Critics, comments, suggestions are all welcomed. Feel free to contribute if you want to.

## Examples of options pricing in Python and C++
Check [this article](http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/european-option-pricing-with-python.html) for some examples written in Python and C++ of the algorithms used (Monte Carlo and Black & Scholes formula).
