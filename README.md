# Option Pricing Class
A "sidehobby" more than a sideproject: a class to price options written in Java. 
I plan to add other derivatives and pricing methods although there is no fixed schedule or plan.
Critics, comments, suggestions are all welcomed.

# Examples of pricing options in Python and C++
Check http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/european-option-pricing-with-python.html for the article with examples written in Python and C++ of the algorith used (Monte Carlo and Black & Scholes formula).
